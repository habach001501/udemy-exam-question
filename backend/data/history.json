Create a CloudWatch Alarm linked to the metric and use SNS as a target. Create an email subscription on SNS</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can search and filter the log data by creating one or more metric filters. Metric filters define the terms and patterns to look for in log data as it is sent to CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch Logs uses these metric filters to turn log data into numerical CloudWatch metrics that you can graph or set an alarm on. Filters do not retroactively filter data. Filters only publish the metric data points for events that happen after the filter was created.</p>\n\n<p>You can use metric filters to search for and match terms, phrases, or values in your log events. When a metric filter finds one of the terms, phrases, or values in your log events, you can increment the value of a CloudWatch metric. For example, you can create a metric filter to search for and count the occurrence of the word ERROR in your log events.</p>\n\n<p>CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter Concepts:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-dop-pt/assets/pt1-q39-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html</a></p>\n\n<p>For the given use-case, you can have Beanstalk send the logs to CloudWatch Logs, and then create a metric filter. This will create a metric for us (and not an alarm), and on top of the metric, you can create a CloudWatch Alarm. This alarm will send a notification to SNS, which will, in turn, send us emails.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter with a target being a CloudWatch Alarm. Make the CloudWatch Alarm use SNS as a target. Create an email subscription on SNS</strong> - You cannot directly set a CloudWatch Alarm as a target for a CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter. You will first need to create a metric filter which can then be used to create a CloudWatch metric to be eventually used in a CloudWatch Alarm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use the Elastic Beanstalk Health Metrics to monitor the application health and track the error rates. Create a CloudWatch alarm on top of the metric and use SNS as a target. Create an email subscription on SNS</strong> - The Elastic Beanstalk Health Metrics will not track the errors sent out to a log file, so it does not meet the requirements of the use-case. Besides, CloudWatch alarm cannot be used to work on top of the Elastic Beanstalk Health Metrics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implement custom logic in your Node.js application to track the number of errors it has received in the last 5 minutes. In case the number exceeds the threshold, use the <code>SetAlarmState</code> API to trigger a CloudWatch alarm. Make the CloudWatch Alarm use SNS as a target. Create an email subscription on SNS</strong> - Implementing custom logic in your Node.js application may seem like a good idea, but then you have to remember that your application can be distributed amongst many servers with Beanstalk, and as such it will not be possible to track the \"100 errors\" across all instances using this methodology.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html</a></p>\n"

Secure your API using Cognito</strong></p>\n\n<p>API Gateway APIs can directly invoke an AWS service and pass in a payload. It's a common way to provide a publicly available and secure API for your chosen AWS services.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon API Gateway integrates with AWS Step Functions, allowing you to call Step Functions with APIs that you create to simplify and customize interfaces to your applications. Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices as a series of steps in a visual workflow. You create state machines in the Step Functions Console or through the Step Functions API to specify and execute the steps of your application at scale. API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.</p>\n\n<p>How API Gateway Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/serverless/New-API-GW-Diagram.c9fc9835d2a9aa00ef90d0ddc4c6402a2536de0d.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\">https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/</a></p>\n\n<p>How Step Functions Work:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Step%20Functions/sfn_how-it-works.f795601e8338db32506b9abb01e71704f483fc81.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/\">https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/</a></p>\n\n<p>For the given use-case, you need to implement the payment workflow using Step Functions. A key reason you need this integration is that AWS Lambda has a max concurrent execution of 1000, while API gateway has a max concurrent execution of 10000. By integrating API Gateway and Step Functions together, you bypass any limit Lambda would have imposed on you.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create the booking workflow in Step Functions.

Secure your API using Cognito</strong> - AWS Lambda has a max concurrent execution of 1000, while API gateway has a max concurrent execution of 10000. By integrating API Gateway and Step Functions together, you bypass any limit Lambda would have imposed on you. So there is no need to use Lambda as an intermediary for this workflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create the booking workflow in AWS Lambda.

The Lambda function will wait for the service provider's response and then issue the status back to the client.

          "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Config</strong> provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.</p><p>When you add a rule to your account, you can specify when you want AWS Config to run the rule; this is called a <em>trigger</em>.

You choose which resources trigger the evaluation by defining the rule's <em>scope</em>. The scope can include the following:</p><p>- One or more resource types</p><p>- A combination of a resource type and a resource ID</p><p>- A combination of a tag key and value</p><p>- When any recorded resource is created, updated, or deleted</p><p>AWS Config runs the evaluation when it detects a change to a resource that matches the rule's scope.

Otherwise, evaluations are triggered when any recorded resource changes.</p><p><strong>Periodic</strong></p><p>AWS Config runs evaluations for the rule at a frequency that you choose (for example, every 24 hours).</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Set up an AWS Config rule with a configuration change trigger that will detect any changes in the S3 bucket configuration and which will also invoke an AWS Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function that will revert any changes.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Using Amazon EventBridge, integrate an Event Bus with AWS CloudTrail API in order to trigger an AWS Lambda function that will detect and revert any particular changes</strong> is incorrect. Although you can track all changes to your configuration using CloudTrail API, it would be difficult to integrate it with EventBridge in order to monitor the changes. There is no direct way of integrating these two services and you have to create a custom mapping in order for this to work.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Integrate Amazon EventBridge and an AWS Lambda function to create a scheduled job that runs every hour to scan the IAM policy attached to the federated access role. Configure the function to detect as well as revert any recent changes made in the current configuration</strong> is incorrect. Although this solution may work, there would be a significant delay since the Lambda function is only run every one hour. So if the new S3 bucket configuration was applied at 12:05 PM, the change will only be detected at 1:00 PM. Moreover, this entails a lot of overhead since you have to develop a custom function that will scan your IAM policies.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up an AWS Config rule with a periodic trigger that runs every hour which will detect any changes in the S3 bucket configuration. Associate an AWS Lambda function in the rule that will revert any recent changes made in the bucket<em> </em></strong>is incorrect. Although this may work, it is not the fastest way of detecting a change in your resource configurations in AWS. Since the rule is using a periodic trigger, the rule will run every hour and not in near real-time, unlike the <strong><em>Configuration changes</em></strong> trigger. So, say a new configuration was applied at 12:01 PM, the change will only be detected at 1:00 PM after the rule has been run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config-rules.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config-rules.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_develop-rules_getting-started.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_develop-rules_getting-started.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Config Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-config/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-config/</a></p>"
